AI-Powered Fraud Detection System for Rented Bank Accounts-
**SPAI Model (Secure Path AI)**

📌 Overview  
Cybercriminals rent bank accounts to conduct financial fraud, making detection difficult. Our **SPAI-powered** web application prevents such frauds by leveraging real-time transaction monitoring, behavioral analytics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure banking operations.

🚀 Features  
✅ **SPAI AI-Powered Fraud Detection** – Identifies suspicious transactions using machine learning.  
✅ **Fraud Risk Scoring System** – Assigns a risk score based on transaction behavior using **SPAI**’s behavioral analytics.  
✅ Automated Account Freezing & Alerts – Blocks fraudulent transactions and notifies users.  
✅ Enhanced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – OTP & biometric verification for high-risk transactions powered by **SPAI**.  
✅ Real-Time Admin Dashboard – Provides live fraud alerts to bank officials using **SPAI**'s analytics.  
✅ Blockchain-Based Secure KYC (Future Scope) – Immutable identity verification for secure onboarding, powered by **SPAI**.

📌 How Rented Accounts Are Used for Fraud  
🔹 Criminals target students, unemployed individuals, or low-income people via social media & job scams.  
🔹 Stolen or illegal funds are transferred into rented accounts using phishing, fake loans, and dark web transactions.  
🔹 Money is quickly moved via IMPS, RTGS, NEFT, UPI, or converted into cryptocurrency to erase trails.  
🔹 "Money mules" withdraw cash from ATMs or make fake purchases to launder money.

🛠️ Technical Implementation  
**SPAI** System Architecture:  
1️⃣ User logs into the banking system.  
2️⃣ **SPAI** AI monitors login behavior & transactions.  
3️⃣ Fraud Risk Score is calculated based on **SPAI** behavioral analytics.  
4️⃣ If flagged, **SPAI** triggers MFA & biometric verification.  
5️⃣ If fraud is confirmed, the account is frozen & reported to authorities using **SPAI**’s fraud detection system.

📌 Tech Stack  
| Layer         | Technology         |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Frontend      | React.js, TailwindCSS |
| Backend       | Node.js, WebSockets |
| Database      | MySQL / Firebase   |
| AI Models     | TensorFlow, Scikit-learn |
| Security      | AES Encryption, OAuth 2.0 |

🔄 Process Flow Diagram  
1️⃣ User logs in → **SPAI** AI monitors login behavior.  
2️⃣ **SPAI** analyzes transactions → Assigns a risk score.  
3️⃣ Decision based on risk level:  

Low Risk: Transaction proceeds.  
Medium Risk: Triggers OTP/device verification.  
High Risk: Account frozen & flagged for manual review.  
4️⃣ Final decision: If fraud is detected, the account is permanently blocked and reported.
